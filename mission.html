    <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
    <div class="white">
    <p>Our objective for this project is to be a safety cushion for the spread of Covid 19. The purpose of the app is an attempt to predict and pinpoint where any potential hotspots for the virus will occur. It will discourage people from entering any potential “danger zones” or places with high activity. The main feature of this app is that in the case of a confirmed case, all relating parties who were potentially in contact with will be warned. This will be done through background algorithms so the user is expected to do the bare minimum.
